In each of the projects:

```bash
$ npm install
...
$ gulp js # one-time JS compilation
$ gulp build # minified production-ready JS compilation
$ gulp watch # watch the filesystem and automatically run the js task
```

Then run the `index.htm`. (Doesn't even have to be on the localhost.)

TODO: make the `watch` task faster (watchify, browserify)
